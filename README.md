# Federal Income Tax Calculator
 Hi, thanks for viewing this project I am working on.
 Please look at the taxes.js file for the federal income tax calculator.
 I based my code off a single filer, with the current $12,550 standard deductible, and a $6,000 401k deductible as well.
 Feel free to copy the code and change the net income variable at the top to get different calculated federal tax amounts. 
 Thanks for supporting me!
