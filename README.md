 Hi, thanks for viewing this github project I am working on.
 Please look at the taxes.js file for the federal income tax calculator.
 I based my code off a single filer, with the current 12550 standard deductible, and a 6000 401k max deductible as well.
 Feel free to copy the code and change the net income variable at the top to get different calculated federal tax amounts. 
 Thanks for supporting me!
